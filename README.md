Tools: SQL (DuckDB/MotherDuck), R (tidyverse, ggplot2, leaflet, ggiraph, R markdown).

Objective: This project analyzes bike rideshare data from October 2024 to October 2025 to identify behavioral differences between members and casual riders and propose strategies for converting casual riders to members. The analysis focuses on:

- Yearly, seasonal, day-of-week, time-of-day, distance-segment, and duration-segment usage patterns
- Geospatial data used to calculate ride-distance metrics and visualize ride concentration
- Timestamp data used to derive ride-time metrics

This project uses SQL for data cleaning, compilation, and analysis, and R for visualization. The final project was produced as an R Markdown report.
